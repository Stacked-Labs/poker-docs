# Core Features

## 2.1 Instant Wallet Integration

Stacked offers seamless integration with Web3 wallets and popular social logins, making user authentication and transactions frictionless. Skip the traditional account setup—simply connect with your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby Wallet, Coinbase) or choose a social login through Thirdweb, like Google, Discord, or X (formerly Twitter), and you’re set to play. With compatibility across over 100 wallets and diverse social platforms, Stacked ensures maximum accessibility and convenience, letting you jump into the action effortlessly.

## 2.2 Flexible Token Support

Players can use any ERC-20 token to play. Stacked supports a variety of tokens, including:

- **Stablecoins:** USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.
- **DeFi Tokens:** UNI, AAVE, COMP, etc.
- **Meme Tokens:** SHIB, etc.

This opens up a new world for poker players who want to bet using the tokens they already hold.

## 2.3 Smart Contract Governance

Each poker game is governed by its own unique smart contract. These smart contracts serve as the “banker” for the game, securely holding player deposits, updating player stacks in real time, and processing payouts at the end of the game.

## 2.4 Seamless Integration for Communities

No matter the token or community, setting up a game is quick and easy. Log in, choose the ERC-20 token you want to wager, generate a game link, and share it with fellow token holders. The platform supports any ERC-20 token, allowing your community to engage in poker with their favorite assets effortlessly.
