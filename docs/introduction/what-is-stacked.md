## How It Works

### Step 1: Connect a Wallet

Users connect their crypto wallets to the platform to start hosting or joining poker games.

### Step 2: Generate a Game Link

Hosts can generate a game link through a smart contract bank and share it with friends and the community.

### Step 3: Deposit Buy-in

Players who join the game log in with their wallets and deposit their buy-ins directly into the smart contract bank.

### Step 4: Payouts

At the end of the game, players are automatically paid out their respective stacks to their connected wallets.
