# Target Market

## 5.1 Crypto Enthusiasts

Stacked is tailored for the rapidly growing cryptocurrency community—people who are eager to use their digital assets in meaningful, engaging ways. By allowing players to wager with a range of ERC-20 tokens, Stacked gives crypto holders an opportunity to play, compete, and engage in a familiar game, all while leveraging the assets they already own.

## 5.2 Gaming Communities

Online poker players have long been drawn to flexible, dynamic gaming environments, and Stacked delivers by removing traditional platform limitations. Using Web3 infrastructure and smart contracts, Stacked eliminates intermediaries, allowing for a seamless, decentralized experience that removes typical barriers, such as KYC and restricted payment methods. The platform’s open setup makes it particularly appealing for gaming communities that value autonomy and innovation in their gaming experiences.

## 5.3 Token Communities

Stacked uniquely supports niche token-based communities by allowing members to play games using their preferred ERC-20 tokens. This feature offers an engaging way for these communities to create stronger connections by competing directly for tokens they are passionate about. Whether it's betting with popular tokens like USDC and DAI or more community-specific tokens, Stacked lets users represent and support their token ecosystems in a competitive setting.

Token communities can use Stacked to foster deeper engagement, turning static token holdings into active, community-driven assets. Additionally, by using their preferred tokens in poker games, these communities can enhance their token’s visibility and potentially attract new members, who see utility and enjoyment tied to these assets. This functionality allows Stacked to be a unifying platform, connecting diverse crypto communities through their favorite tokens in a competitive, enjoyable environment.
