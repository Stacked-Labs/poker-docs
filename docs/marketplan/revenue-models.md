# Revenue Models

- **Ad Space**  
  Opportunities to monetize through custom felt logos on the poker tables or chat message blurbs. 
- **Game Creation Fee**  
  Charge a $X fee every time a user creates a game. This fee includes contract deployment costs and covers the gas fees througout the game.
- **Protocol Pot Fee**  
  Every hand played on the platform updates the stack data in the game contract, taking a X% fee, which is split between the protocol and the game owner.
