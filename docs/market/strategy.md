# Market Strategy

## Target Market

Our primary target market includes crypto enthusiasts, online gaming communities, and token-based communities. We aim to attract users who are passionate about cryptocurrency and want an entertaining, engaging way to interact with their tokens. By introducing poker, we offer an exciting activity that not only brings more utility and visibility to their assets but also fosters a stronger, more close-knit community spirit. This added layer of competition and fun transforms typical token holding into a shared experience, creating deeper connections and enhancing the sense of belonging within the community.

## Marketing Channels

1. **Social Media:** Utilize platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Discord to engage with the crypto and poker communities. Promotion of user hosted games to help game creators find players and for players to find games and new tokens.
2. **Influencer Partnerships:** Collaborate with popular influencers within the crypto and poker spaces to promote our platform. They are incentivized to host games for their own communities, earning a percentage of the protocol pot fees. This creates a mutually beneficial relationship, where influencers have a direct stake in the success of the games they host.
3. **Content Marketing:** Create engaging and fun content, including blog posts, videos, and tutorials. Taking advantage of meme coin characters to promote the games while keeping the content lighthearted and fun.
4. **Community Engagement:** Foster a strong community through interactive events, tournaments, and discussions on our platform and social media channels.

## User Acquisition and Retention Strategies

1. **Strategic Partnerships:** Form alliances with crypto projects, online gaming platforms, and poker communities to expand our reach and user base.

2. **Incentivized Games:** Host games featuring mystery jackpots and rewards in random tokens collected by the protocol, ensuring continued player engagement.

3. **Profit Share:** Split protocol pot fees with game creators to motivate them to promote and sustain their games.

4. **Loyalty Programs:** Reward loyal game organizers with increased incentives, including a larger share of the protocol pot fees, to foster ongoing contributions.
