# Introduction

## 1.1 What is Stacked?

Stacked is the ultimate platform for poker enthusiasts who want to enjoy their favorite game using cryptocurrency. It allows users to set up and play poker with any ERC-20 token, combining the fun of poker with the security and efficiency of DeFi. Stacked removes the need for traditional intermediaries like bankers (the game hosts who act as a trusted third-party handling payments with Venmo, Cashapp, Revolut, etc.), offering a seamless and trustless experience where you and your friends can bet directly using your crypto assets.

## 1.2 Why Stacked?

Stacked stands out from traditional poker platforms by offering several key advantages:

### Instant Setup

Players can start playing poker by simply connecting their Web3 wallet—no account registrations or downloads required. Over 100 different wallets are supported, including popular options like MetaMask, Rabby, and Coinbase. Utilizing Thirdweb as a connection solution, allowing users to also set up with traditional accounts such as Google, Discord, X, etc.

### Play for Any ERC-20

Whether it's a well-known stablecoin like USDC or a memecoin like SHIB, players can wager using any ERC-20 token. This provides flexibility and broadens the poker experience for crypto enthusiasts.

### Trustless Play

Every game on Stacked is managed through smart contracts, ensuring that all player deposits and payouts are handled securely, without any need for manual intervention or reliance on a central authority.

### Fair Revenue Share

Bankers are a key part of the Stacked ecosystem, responsible for creating games and attracting players. To reward their contributions, Stacked ensures that 50% of the Protocol Pot Fee from each game is paid out to the Banker at the end of the game. This way, Bankers benefit directly from the platform’s success and are motivated to continue generating games.
